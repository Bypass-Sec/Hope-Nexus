# Hope Nexus üåç

Hope Nexus is a centralized humanity platform built on Next.js and Supabase. It aims to coordinate, simplify, and centralize donations and campaigns among both individuals and non-profits.

## The Leading Problem üö®

In the aftermath of a disaster, communities face urgent and diverse needs, varying from food, clean water, and shelter to healthcare and sanitation supplies. However, there is often a gap between the immediate needs of affected populations and the timing of donations received, giving rise to challenges like uncoordinated donations, excessive supply of certain goods, under-supply of others as well as logistical challenges that cause further delays in delivering aid.

A recent study has shown the lack of motivation for individuals to make a difference elsewhere, along with the deficiency of communication and coordination between non-profit organizations has created a sense of distrust for people to make donations, which makes it a real problem that must be addressed. "Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile." says Albert Einstein, and his quote resonates with what we aim to encourage using our platform.

## The Digital Solution üí°

Our software, Hope Nexus, is a web app that helps coordinate, simplify, and centralize donations and campaigns among both individuals and non-profits.

It will give users who are new to donating an easy and streamlined experience at choosing which area to donate to, and to which nonprofit organization via an interactive, easy-to-use map with a secure payment system.

It will also allow collaboration among Non-profits around the world to communicate & create update logs for individuals to view & stay up to date with the progress of a certain funding campaign while having the authority to create new campaigns according to needs around the world.

These features in a single platform have not been replicated once before. Handling donations and choosing the right organization users want to fund has never been easier, for our objective is to create a hub for humanity where everybody can work together as a nexus of hope to help solve the world's biggest crises.
